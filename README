Walter is a single header library for writing unit tests in C made
with fewer complications.  David is an extension that define more
assertion macros.

Comparing to other similar libraries this focus on minimizing tests
setup AKA boilerplate and prints direct paths with line number to
failed or pending tests while keeping implementation short.

I would like to say that code is simple but it's mostly macro magic
and global state.  So better hold your wizards hat while reading.

	walter.h     Library, includes licence and documentation
	david.h      Extra macros for walter, FILE, IO, processes

Should work on POSIX systems  \(._. )/
