Walter is a single header library for writing unit tests in C made
with fewer complications.

Files:

	walter.h     Library with documentation and example
	demo0.t.c    Simple example
	demo1.t.c    Here all tests should pass
	demo2.t.c    Here all tests should fail
	demo3.t.c    Example with custom test functions
	test         Script to compile and run demo programs

Compile and run:

	$ cc -o demo0.t demo0.t.c    # Compile
	$ ./demo0.t -h               # Print usage help
	$ ./demo0.t                  # Run tests
	$ ./demo0.t -v               # Run in verbose mode
	$ ./demo0.t -q               # End quick on first fail
	$ ./demo0.t -vq              # Captain obvious
